# 🚧 Fix Our Alley - Brighton Park Pothole Crisis

A community-driven initiative to demand complete reconstruction of the dangerous alley between Pershing Road and 38th Place (Spaulding to Homan) in Chicago's Ward 12.

🌐 **Live Site**: [brighton-park-potholes.vercel.app](https://brighton-park-potholes.vercel.app)

This website empowers residents to quickly and easily contact Alderwoman Julia Ramirez about the dangerous conditions in our alley. After years of neglect and a failed patch job by the previous administration, our alley is now in WORSE condition than before - filled with potholes, glass shards, and nails. We demand complete reconstruction, not another band-aid solution.
